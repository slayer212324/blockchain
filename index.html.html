    <h1 style="color: firebrick;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><u>Metamask wallet</u></h1>  
    <p style="font-size:larger ;">metamask wallet is a virtual wallet seriya and is used to store crypto currency and do transactions with it basically (e-wallet) </p>
    <h1 style="color: firebrick;"><u>Web3.js</u> :))</h1>
    Now what is web3.js : it is a collection of like libraries which allows like to  hosts decentralised apps that run on the blockchain technology .. (seri ipo decentralised apps na ena nu kete na anything u can do with a peer to peer connection oru intermediate yaarum ilama onala things pana mudiyum for example, decentralised exchange u can buy sell trade cryptocurrency without the need of an intermediate seriya) so to host such decentralised apps on blockchain u can study web3.js which is front end similar to react, but to make it user friendly u need react puridha..</p>    
    <h1 style="color: firebrick;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><u>Smart contracts</u></h1>
    for Smart contracts are simply programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. (oru example ku solanum na ipo oru vehicle insurance smart contract create panre nu assume panipom so indha smart contract oda vela ena nu ketena  vandhu is to like deploy vehicle maintanence every 6 months for example.. That depends on how you code it and it is coded on solidity(programming language) which is on blockchain basically...</p>
    <h2 style="color:deeppink">Now if u are a skilled smart contract developer: </h2>
    <img src="Screenshot 2022-10-04 103433.png" alt="smart contract developer salaries">    
    <h2 style="color:darkslateblue ;">look at the paycheck man its just wham..!!</h2>
    <h1 style="color: firebrick;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><u>Distributed storage (IPFS and INFURA):</u></h1>
    ipo nee pathe nu vechiko when u see an nft its not the actual image thats popping up its actually the url that is being directed to the distributed storage and that is where the actual nft image exists basically the distributed storage has the content and usually and there would be urls to direct to the distributed storage so yea..</h2>
    <h1 style="color:firebrick;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><u>Geth/Ganache</u></h1>
    <p style="font-size:larger ;">Is an Ethereum-client, which means that you can run your own private blockchain with it. You can adjust your needs by defining for example the amount of threads you offer for mining. Geth itself is a command line tool, which can run a full Ethereum node implemented in Go.(ethereum node means a collection of Ethereum-clients)</p>         
    <p style="font-size:larger;">If you want a GUI, where you can track all deployments and transactions on your blockchain, you can choose Ganache. It allows you to create your own private blockchain mainly for testing purposes.</p>
    <h1 style="color:hotpink; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"><u>Now, lets talk about the relationship between them</u></h1>
    <p style="font-size:larger;">ipo nee paathena web3.js la when you host the decentralised apps to take full control of it you need a wallet ipo nee oru decentralised exchange web3.js vechi create panre apdina you need a wallet to trade buy or sell stuff in it la so in that way web3.js is connected with wallet..</p>    
    
    <p style="font-size:larger;">obviously geth and ganache should be connected to the wallet</p>

    <p style="font-size:larger ;">ipo dhan react oda role varum idhula react connects all the three smart contract,web3.js,distributed storage in a user friendly website.. do you get the connection now??</p>
    <h1 style="color:orange ;"><u>the combination of all this when done right is this down here:</u></h1>
